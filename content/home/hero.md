# Hi, I'm Branden.

I'm a software developer, maker, and artist.

I'm the Director of Software at [AV&C](av-controls.com) where I lead my team of developers as we collaborate with XD and Systems teams to create amazing digital landmarks for the physical world.

I co-founded [MoreBetter](morebetter.ltd) and helped create [Releaf App](releafapp.com) as well as other software tools to help patients and researchers.

I'm also on the Board of Directors for [FirePony Creative Society](firepony.org) where get to work with amazing people to run regional Burning Man events in the mid-Atlantic region and help bring burner ideals to the default world.
